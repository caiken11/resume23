Summary
 
Highly motivated, career-changer and full-stack trained developer with a proven ability to learn quickly and drive outcomes in demanding environments. With over a decade of experience managing clients and projects, plus two years of software engineering focused on server-side backend development, I am an asset for dynamic teams delivering user-focused software solutions to real-world problems. As a self-starter accustomed to small nonprofits, startups and under-resourced workplaces requiring everyone to wear multiple hats, I look for growth opportunities and inclusive work cultures where knowledge-sharing and coaching are norms.

Experience
 
Concentrix Catalyst | Software Engineer, Senior Associate	                       2021 – 2023
•	Collaborated with an agile cross-team of developers, testers, managers, and third-party vendors through the SDLC to deliver user-focused applications for multiple Fortune 500 clients. 
•	Researched Amazon Cognito and other services to gain a deep understanding of its features and capabilities, becoming the project’s subject matter expert in that area and leading the development and maintenance of all services reliant on AWS. This expanded my skill set and allowed me to coach my teammates and support a culture of continuous learning.
•	Contributed to testing automation by writing effective unit tests using JUnit and Mockito to achieve over 85% code coverage as measured by JaCoCo. This facilitated faster bug detection and refactoring, increased confidence and ultimately improved the code quality of the large-scale web application now used by millions of customers. 
•	Resolved bugs in production and overcame DevOps related issues as the sole developer supporting the client’s enterprise-grade application during the maintenance phase. Limited the negative impact to the client’s business operations by quickly diagnosing root cause using Postman to test APIs and search queries to analyze log data in AWS CloudWatch. Demonstrated excellent debugging skills when refactoring batch processing, queues, and messaging methods to ensure accurate processing of customer orders, then pushed changes to GitHub and used Azure pipeline for monitoring deployment.
•	Exemplified proficiency in object-oriented software design and SOLID development principles in writing testable, scalable, and highly-readable Java code for new features, leveraging the Spring framework to streamline development, and relying on SonarLint, testing automation, and peer reviews for an efficient development process. This ensured the expected functionality and on-time delivery of critical app components.

KickUp, Inc. | Client Success Manager	2018 – 2020
•	Ensured client success using detailed knowledge of the product’s backend functionality to anticipate potential challenges, advise clients on alternative approaches and adapt application setup to circumvent known limitations and bugs. 
•	Served as a key intermediary between the engineering team of our startup and our clients, effectively translating client needs, product limitations, and identified bugs into actionable feedback for future product updates and enhancements, resulting in a more responsive and client-centric software development process. 
•	Demonstrated exceptional ability to adopt new technologies and quickly learn the intricacies of the application by adjusting clients’ use cases to incorporate newly-released features, diagnosing technical issues, and resolving errors, thereby enhancing the overall adaptability and problem-solving capacity of our small team.

KIPP Memphis Collegiate Schools | Data Analyst, Manager of Special Projects	2014 – 2017
•	Designed a simplified regional database and built a user-friendly website displaying dashboards with real-time data, then engaged stakeholders in piloting the tools to generate insights, understand data needs, and identify pain points in utilization. 
•	Defined a long-term database design and data visualization solution, detailing the system architecture, data structure, data sources, and key performance indicators essential for informed decision-making and tracking progress toward regional goals.
